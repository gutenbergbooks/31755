	<h1>POLITICAL
	APPLICATION</h1>
	<p id="author">by … John Victor Peterson</p>
	<p id="prolog">If matter transference really
	works—neanderthalers can
	pop up anywhere. And that’s
	very hard on politicians!</p>
</div>
<div id="story">
	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Some</span> say scientists should keep
	their noses out of politics. Benson
	says it’s to prevent damage to their
	olfactory senses. Benson’s a physicist.</p>

	<p>I’ve known Allan Benson for a
	long time. In fact I’ve bodyguarded
	him for years and think I understand
	him better than he does himself.
	And when he shook security
	at White Sands, my boss didn’t
	hesitate to tell me that knowing
	Benson as I do I certainly shouldn’t
	have let him skip off. Or crisp
	words to that effect.</p>

	<p>The pressure was on. Benson
	was seeking a new fuel—or a way
	of compressing a known fuel—to
	carry a torchship to Mars. His loss
	could mean a delay of decades. We
	knew he’d been close, but not <em>how</em>
	close.</p>

	<p>My nickname’s Monk. I’ve
	fought it, certainly, but what can
	you do when a well-wishing mother
	names you after a wealthy uncle
	and your birth certificate says
	Neander Thalberg? As early as
	high school some bright pundit
	noted the name’s similarity to that
	of a certain prehistoric man. Unfortunately
	the similarity is not in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page109" title="109"> </a>name alone: I’m muscular, stooped,
	and, I must admit, not handsome
	hero model material.</p>

	<p>Well, maybe the nickname’s
	justified, but still, Al Benson didn’t
	have to give the crowning insult.
	And yet, if he hadn’t, there probably
	wouldn’t be a torchship stern-ending
	on Mars just about now.</p>

	<p>C. I. (Central Intelligence, that
	is) at the Sands figured Benson
	would head for New York. Which
	is why the boss sent me here. I
	registered in a hotel in the 50’s
	and, figuring that whatever Benson
	intended to do would have spectacular
	results, I kept the stereo
	on News.</p>

	<p>Benson’s wife hadn’t yielded
	much info. Sure she described the
	clothes he was wearing and said
	he’d taken nothing else except an
	artist’s case. What was in that was
	anybody’s guess; his private lab is
	such a jumble nobody could tell
	what, if anything, was missing.</p>

	<p>C. I. knew his political feelings.
	Seems he’d been talking wild about
	the upcoming presidential election
	and had sworn he’d nip the draft-Cadigan
	movement in the bud.
	Cadigan’s Mayor of New York
	City. He’s anti-space. In fact, Cadigan’s
	anti just about everything in
	science except intercontinental missiles.
	Strictly for defense, of course.
	Cadigan says.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">A weathercaster was making
	rash promises on the stereo when
	the potray dinged. The potray?
	I certainly wasn’t expecting mail.
	Only C. I. knew where I was and
	they’d have closed-circuited me on
	visio if they wanted contact.</p>

	<p>The potray dinged and there
	was a package in it.</p>

	<p>Now matter transference I knew.
	It put mailmen out of business.
	There’s a potray in every domicile
	and you can put things in it, dial
	the destination and they come out
	there. They come out the same size
	and weight and in the same condition
	as they went in, provided
	they didn’t go in alive. Life loses,
	as many a shade of a hopeful guinea
	pig could relate.</p>

	<p>So the potray dinged and here
	was this package. At first glance
	it looked like one of those cereal
	samples manufacturers have been
	everlastingly sending through since
	postal rates dropped after cost of
	the potrays had been amortized.
	But cereal samples don’t come
	through at midday; they’re night
	traffic stuff.</p>

	<p>The package was light, its wrapping
	curiously smooth. There was
	an envelope attached with my correct
	name and potray number.
	Whoever had mailed it must be in
	C. I. or must know someone in
	C. I. who knew where I was.</p>

	<p>The postmark was blurred but
	I could make out that it had been
	cast from Grand Central. Time
	didn’t matter. It couldn’t have
	been cast more than a microsecond
	earlier.</p>

	<p>The envelope contained a card
	upon which was typed:</p>

	<p>“Caution! Site on cylinder of 2
	<a class="pagenum" id="page110" title="110"> </a>ft. radius and 6 ft. height. Unwrap
	at armslength.”</p>

	<p>Now what? A practical joke?
	If so, it must be Benson’s work.
	He’s played plenty, from pumping
	hydrogen sulphide (that’s rotten
	egg gas, as you know) into the
	air-conditioning system at high
	school to calling a gynecologist to
	the launching stage at the Sands
	to sever an umbilical cord which
	he neglected to say was on a Viking
	rocket.</p>

	<p>I followed the instructions. As I
	bent back the first fold of the
	strange wrapping it came alive, unfolding
	itself with incredible swiftness.</p>

	<p>Something burst forth like a
	freed djinn—almost instantaneously
	lengthening, spreading—a thing
	with beetling brows, low, broad
	forehead, prognathous jaw, and a
	hunched, brutally muscular body,
	with a great club over its swollen
	shoulder.</p>

	<p>I went precipitously backward
	over a coffee table.</p>

	<p>It stabilized, a dead mockery,
	replica of a Neanderthal.</p>

	<p>A placard hung on its chest. I
	read this:</p>

	<p>“Even some of the early huntsmen
	weren’t successful. Abandon
	the chase, Monk. I’ve things to do
	and this—your blood brother, no
	doubt—couldn’t catch me any more
	than you can!”</p>

	<p>Which positively infuriated me.</p>

	<p>Do you blame me?</p>

	<p>A few cussing, cussed minutes
	later I realized what Al Benson had
	apparently done: solved the torchship’s
	fuel problem.</p>

	<p>Oh, I’d seen Klein bottles and
	Mobius strips and other things
	that twist in on themselves and
	into other dimensions, twisting into
	microcosms and macrocosms—into
	elsewhere, in any event. And here
	I had visual evidence that Benson
	had had something nearly six feet
	tall and certainly two feet in
	breadth enclosed in a nearly weightless
	carton less than eight inches
	on the side!</p>

	<p>Sufficient fuel for a Marstrip?
	Just wrap it up!</p>

	<p>The stereo’s audio was saying:
	“… from the Museum of Natural
	History. Curators are compiling a
	list of the missing exhibits which
	we will reveal to you on this channel
	as soon as it’s available. Now
	we switch to Dick Joy at City Hall
	with news of the latest exhibit
	found. Come in, Dick!”</p>

	<p>On the steps of City Hall was
	a full size replica of a mastodon
	over whose massive back was
	draped a banner bearing the slogan:
	“The Universal Party is for you!
	Don’t return to prehistory with
	Cadigan! Re-elect President Ollie
	James and go to the stars!”</p>

	<p>And there was a closeup of
	Mayor Cadigan standing pompous
	and wrathful—and looking very
	diminutive—behind the emblem
	of his opposition party.</p>

	<p>Dick Joy was saying, “Eyewitnesses
	claim that this replica—obviously
	one of the items stolen
	from the Museum of Natural History—suddenly
	<a class="pagenum" id="page111" title="111"> </a>materialized here.
	Immediately prior to the alleged
	materialization a man—whose photograph
	we show now—ostensibly
	bent down to tie a shoelace, setting
	a shoebox beside him. He left
	the box, walking off into the gathering
	crowd, and this mastodon
	<em>seemed</em> to spring into being where
	the shoebox had been.</p>

	<p>“The mastodon replica has been
	examined. A report just handed me
	says it is definitely that from the
	Museum and that it could not conceivably
	have been contained in a
	shoebox. It’s obviously a case of
	mass hypnotism. The replica must
	have been trucked here. There’s no
	other possible explanation. Excuse
	me!”</p>

	<p>Dick Joy turned away, then back.</p>

	<p>“I have just been handed a notice
	that Mayor Cadigan wishes to say
	a few words and I hereby introduce
	him, His Honor the Mayor, Joseph
	F. Cadigan!”</p>

	<p>His balding, fragmentarily curly-haired
	Honor glared.</p>

	<p>“Friends,” he said chokingly,
	“whatever madman is responsible
	for this outrageous act will not go
	unpunished. I call upon the City’s
	Finest to track him down and bring
	him to justice.</p>

	<p>“I am for justice, for equality
	and peace. I—”</p>

	<p>His Honor was apparently determined
	to use all the time he could.
	Being a newscast, it was for free.</p>

	<p>I killed the stereo. And the visio
	rang. It was Phil Pollini, the C. I.
	Chief.</p>

	<p>“Monk,” he said, “guess you’ve
	seen the stereo. Al’s out to fix the
	Mayor’s wagon.”</p>

	<p>“Say that again,” I said, having
	a brainstorm.</p>

	<p>“Now, look—” he started.</p>

	<p>“Maybe you’ve got something
	there, Chief,” I cut in. “Cadigan’s
	got the superduper of all wagons—a
	seven passenger luxury limousine
	with bulletproof glass, stereo, a bar,
	venetian blinds and heaven knows
	what else. Hot and cold running
	androids, maybe. He prowls the
	elevated highways with an ‘In Conference’
	sign flashing over the
	windshield. So’s he can’t be wire-tapped
	or miked, I guess. It’d be
	a natch for Al Benson to go for.”</p>

	<p>Pollini grinned.</p>

	<p>“So if you were Benson what’d
	you do to fix the Mayor’s wagon?”</p>

	<p>“Hitch it to a star,” I said, “and
	the closest spot to a star would be
	the observation platform of the
	Greater Empire State.”</p>

	<p>“You’re probably right,” the
	Chief said. “Get going!”</p>

	<p>I got.</p>

	<p>Ten minutes later I walked out
	onto the observation platform on
	the 150th floor of the Greater
	Empire State Building—and found
	an incredulous crowd gathered
	around the mayor’s limousine. I
	felt good. I’d predicted.</p>

	<p>I asked a guard, “How’d it get
	here?”</p>

	<p>His eyebrows were threatening
	a back somersault.</p>

	<p>“Don’t know,” he said. “I was
	looking over the side; then turned
	<a class="pagenum" id="page112" title="112"> </a>around and here it was! You have
	any ideas?”</p>

	<p>Which is when I spotted Al
	Benson.</p>

	<p>I settled for shoving Benson toward
	the elevator, being careful
	since he had a box under each arm.
	We made the elevator and went
	down and it stopped on the 120th
	floor and the operator said,
	“Change here for all lower floors
	and the street—”</p>

	<p>As we waited on the 120th for
	the down elevator, the P. A. system
	barked:</p>

	<p>“Attention all building occupants.
	By order of the Mayor no
	one will be permitted to leave the
	building until further notice. Please
	remain where you are. We will try
	not to inconvenience you for any
	great time.”</p>

	<p>There was no one close to us.</p>

	<p>“Al,” I said, “look, stinker,
	you’ve had your fun but this is it.
	I don’t know what you’ve got in
	those boxes but you’ve got to turn
	them over—and yourself—to the
	next copper who shows. This is a
	civil matter, strictly local, and not
	C. I.”</p>

	<p>Benson grinned. “Got to make
	a delivery first, Monk. Look, there’s
	a potray over there. Can I use it?”</p>

	<p>His grin was infectious. “So
	what are you going to send
	where?” I asked as sternly as I
	could.</p>

	<p>“The Mayor’s personal files,” he
	said. “I managed to carry them
	out of City Hall—once they’d been
	suitably wrapped, of course! I’m
	sending them to the Senate Investigation
	Committee. Don’t worry,
	Monk, His Honor won’t be President
	this or any year!”</p>

	<p>I helped him dial the SIC number.</p>

	<p>“What about the other package?”
	I asked him then.</p>

	<p>“Insurance,” he said. “Come out
	on the setback.”</p>

	<p>He placed the last package on
	the mosaic tile of the terrace, untied
	its string, flipped open the edge
	of the Benson wrapping and jumped
	back.</p>

	<p>It was an NYC police helicopter.</p>

	<p>We potrayed it back from the
	Sands. Suitably wrapped, of course.</p>

	<p>That was a month ago. Most of
	it never came out in the papers.
	Nothing of Benson’s invention.
	C. I. thought it should be squelched,
	at least until Benson and the
	boys get back from Mars.</p>

	<p>Which would be the end except
	for the packages. Yes, Benson left
	a gross of them with me and I’ve
	been mailing them one a day to
	the leaders of the opposition party.
	I don’t truly know what’s in them,
	of course. But it’s very curious that
	the day before the torchship left
	exactly one hundred and forty-four
	cylinders of hydrogen sulphide
	were missing from quartermaster
	stores. Coincidentally one of my
	C. I. friends tells me Benson had
	him rig up a gross of automatic
	releases for gas cylinders.</p>

	<p>Adding it up, it could be a good
	lesson for politicians to keep their
	noses out of science.</p>
